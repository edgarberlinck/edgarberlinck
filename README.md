ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Edgar!

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with a passion for building great software. I started coding back in 2001, and over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with various technologies. These days, youâ€™ll mostly find me working with Node.js, but Iâ€™ve recently fallen in love with Ruby.

I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code and always look for elegant solutions to complex problems. Open source and craftsmanship are at the heart of what I do.

ðŸš€ Tech I Love

	â€¢	Back-end: Node.js, Ruby, Express, Rails
	â€¢	Front-end: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue
	â€¢	Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
	â€¢	DevOps: Docker, AWS, CI/CD

ðŸ’¬ Letâ€™s Chat

Not a big fan of social media, but if you want to talk about code, software, or anything interesting, you can find me on Discord: @edgarberlinck.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers!
